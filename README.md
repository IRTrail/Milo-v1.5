---

Based on the OpenBuilds MiniMill, the Millennium Machines Milo is an open-source project for DIYers to create a reliable, low cost and powerful desktop CNC mill on their own terms. The mill is designed to have the ability to cut aluminium but is also capable of cutting a vast range of softer materials such as composites, woods and plastics.

To get started we'd recommend going through the [documentation](./docs/index.md) - where you can learn about the parts and work needed to get your own machine up and running.

If you would like to follow the development of Milo, please follow us on Reddit: [r/MilleniumMachines](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilleniumMachines/) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ya4UUj7ax2)
